# Prediction of Android Smartphone Battery Usage with Machine Learning

Modern smartphones offer immense capabilities but continue to face battery
life limitations. In this project,we aim to develop a machine learning model to
predict smartphone battery consumption based on varying operating system
configurations and application workloads. We collected smartphone battery
data to gauge the impact of various OS settings (e.g., screen brightness,
network modes) and application workloads on power consumption. Despite
challenges encountered during the data collection phase, we continued to
perform exploratory analysis and preprocessing on the data. We utilized
regression models to train and evaluate our machine learning solution. We
assessed the model’s ability to accurately predict remaining battery life
against the device’s built-in estimates. This research has the potential to
improve battery management strategies and enhance the user experience
for smartphone users.

## Conclusion

We explored Android device functionalities, learning how to access
Developer Options and operating system settings via ADB. While
some settings proved accessible for modification, others remained
elusive. Through this exploration, we gained insights into battery
consumption across various workloads and accessed operating system
settings, extrapolating valuable data from current charge values.
Additionally, we deepened our understanding of data structures and
successfully applied prediction models to this dataset, enriching our
analytical capabilities. Following rigorous training across various
regression models, we identified specific areas warranting refinement.
Upon addressing these focal points, our performance metrics
experienced a remarkable enhancement, showing an impressive
improvement of more than 100%.
